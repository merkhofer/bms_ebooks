==========

[BMS ebooks](https://twitter.com/bms_ebooks) is a Twitter bot that builds tweets based on what other (?human?) users are saying.

It finds the top hashtag-including US trend and builds a chain of words. At this point it uses only bigrams, likely leading to nongrammaticality.

The name is a play on [horse_ebooks](https://twitter.com/Horse_ebooks). However, Horse_ebooks was outed as a person pretending to be a wacky machine... that won't happen here.

TODO:
-----
* duplicate detection, so as not to just rebuild a tweet
* stop lowercasing everything
* really should chunk better
